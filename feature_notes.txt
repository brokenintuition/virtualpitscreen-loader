Session info I need:
TrackName
TrackDisplayName
EventType (don't care about anything but Race probably)
SessionID (this is probably race/split)
SubSessionID (this is probably practice/qual/race)


At session start pull data for each car:

- filter out pace car and cars outside my class

UserName
UserID
TeamID
TeamName
CarNumberRaw
CarClassID
CarID (this is probably the car itself, not the instance of a car)
CarIdx (this is for telemetry)


During the race I want to track 

For each competitor car:

- laps completed
- lap times
- num pit stops/stints
- laps into stint
- what driver is in the car

CarIdxPosition
CarIdxClassPosition
CarIdxOnPitRoad
CarIdxLap
CarIdxLapCommpleted
CarIdxPitStopCount
CarDetails->Driver
HasRetired (I assume this is also caridx)
use HasData(carIdx)



For my car:
- FuelLevel
- FuelLevelPct
- Lap
- LapCompleted
- PlayerCarClassPosition
- PlayerCarPosition
